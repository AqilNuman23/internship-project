## About Us page

Since they make the guideline of how we (my supervisor and I) need to re-design this website (you can read that information on the main README), I must change the yellow/gold something like that and also the disgusting design they look in the first place to look more simple and good looking eye.

Minimalist yeah that sounds better. But I have to take note that the 'Your HR Team' information should not be included in the About Us menu.

- I choose to insert a picture in between the Team and Vision paragraph and my chief quote.
- That chief's quote section should have an outstanding colour blend with it (focus-para).
- The last 3 information about HR should have their own box instead of just those dash, plus should have their own picture too. ( -> )

## What We Do

For this part I have a misunderstanding with my supervisor which I accidently include the original part of the 'What We Do' content to new design templete.

1. Misunderstood design

- Came up with 3 different layout but in the actual development process, I include them all in one page. So that it look ubiquitous.

2. Actual design

- First I think on 'How should I include 7 parts of them to look minimalist?' Then I look up on the internet and come up with a conclusion to do the 'Card banner' method. Where you can scoll/ click button on both side left and right to scroll between the parts.
- Sadly it not working (at that time, but now its work) and I have to change those design to now What We Do design.

Yeah this part was easy because everything inline in one place and they just need some modification to their colours and sizes and also the border.
